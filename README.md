<h1>Property Hunters</h1>

<h2>Real Estate Website (College Project - Internet Applications Development Module)</h2>

<p>The project consists of a design document describing the general website structure, describing
each page in the website, and including a prototype for the proposed website.<br/>

This project required the use of HTML, CSS and PHP to develop a database driven website that includes the following functionality:<br/>
• dynamically generated property / services information<br/>
• dynamically generated testimonials page<br/>
• retrieve data from multiple tables<br/>
• login for administrators to control access to certain parts of the site<br/>
• functionality for administrators to view/edit/delete database entries such as
properties/testimonials/vendors</p>

Property Hunters was the final project I created while studying for a Higher Diploma Degree in Computing. Creating this Real Estate website was challenging as I practiced all that I have learned during University. It was rewarding seeing the result after so many hours of effort.
